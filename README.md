# Using Huffman-Coding-Implementation for-Text-Files-in-C++
This project is based on Huffman Coding, a lossless, bottom-up compression algorithm. It can compress and decompress any text files.  
Implementation in Project-
This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file passed.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file passed back to its original file.

Greedy algorithm is the best approach for solving the Huffman codes problem since it greedily searches for an optimal solution.
